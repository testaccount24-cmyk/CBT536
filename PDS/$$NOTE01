      Note concerning XDI Text Documentation


  I have attempted to convert the Word 97 XDI documentation into
  readable EBCDIC FB-80 format.  Microsoft Word 97 does not easily
  lend itself to this, but the hope is, that the documentation will
  be both readable and able to be followed.  I don't guarantee
  accuracy of the JCL.  You will have to check that against the real
  Word 97 doc.
