      Anti-Virus Note concerning XDI Word97 Documentation

      Member:   $XDIDOC

  This documentation was checked for viruses using Norton Anti-Virus
  definitions updated 11/14/01, which is the latest version, as of the
  date that this member was written.

  I have attempted to convert this documentation into readable EBCDIC
  FB-80 format.  Microsoft Word 97 does not easily lend itself to this,
  but the hope is, that the documentation will be both readable and
  able to be followed.  I don't guarantee accuracy of the JCL.  You
  will have to check that against the real Word 97 doc.
